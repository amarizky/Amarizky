Hello, I'm Yoga!

I have a passion for web development, with a strong focus on backend technologies.

I enjoy learning and constantly exploring new things in the tech world.

Some of my favorite tools and frameworks include CodeIgniter 4 and Node.js.

I have experience with various programming languages and technologies, including PHP, SCSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, Java, and C#.

I'm constantly learning new things and currently I'm focusing on Node.js.

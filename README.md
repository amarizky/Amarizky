Hello, I'm Yoga!

I have a passion for web development, with a strong focus on backend technologies.

I started learning programming since I was in 5th grade and since then I enjoy learning and constantly exploring new things in the tech world.

I have experience with various programming languages and technologies, including AMPscript, PHP, SCSS, TypeScript, SQL and NoSQL, Java, and C#.

I'm constantly learning new things and currently I'm focusing on Typescript and AMPscript.
